# Architectural Decision Records

This file logs significant architectural decisions made during the development of Meridian APRS. New decisions should be appended in order.

## ADR-001: Flutter as Cross-Platform Framework

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Build Meridian APRS with Flutter.

**Rationale:** A single Dart codebase targets all 6 platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, Web) from one repository. Flutter's widget model and strong ecosystem support make it viable for a production-quality APRS client without maintaining separate native codebases. The trade-off is platform-specific plugin availability for serial/BLE — acceptable given the plugin ecosystem (flutter_libserialport, flutter_blue_plus).

## ADR-002: GPL v3 License

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** License Meridian APRS under the GNU General Public License v3.

**Rationale:** GPL v3 ensures all derivatives remain open source, which is consistent with the broader APRS software ecosystem (Dire Wolf, Xastir, APRSDroid are all GPL). GPL v3 is compatible with Apple App Store distribution when the app is free. This keeps contributions flowing back to the community.

## ADR-003: OpenStreetMap via flutter_map

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `flutter_map` with OpenStreetMap tile servers for map rendering.

**Rationale:** No API key required. Open data. OSM tile servers are freely available and well-maintained. `flutter_map` supports both online tile fetching and offline tile caching, leaving a clear path for future offline map support. Avoids vendor lock-in (Google Maps, Mapbox).

## ADR-004: APRS-IS Direct TCP (WebSocket Proxy for Web)

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Connect to APRS-IS via direct TCP socket (`rotate.aprs2.net:14580`) on all platforms except web. On web, use a WebSocket-to-TCP proxy.

**Rationale:** Direct TCP avoids any third-party APRS-IS API dependency and gives full control over the connection (filter strings, keepalives, server rotation). The web platform cannot open raw TCP sockets — this is a hard browser security constraint. A WebSocket proxy is the standard workaround. The limitation is documented and acceptable; web is a secondary target platform.

## ADR-005: Pure Dart Packet Core

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Implement all AX.25 framing and APRS parsing in pure Dart with no FFI.

**Rationale:** Pure Dart runs identically on all 6 Flutter platforms including web (which does not support dart:ffi). The performance of a pure-Dart parser is more than sufficient for APRS packet rates (typically <10 packets/second per filter). This maximizes portability and avoids build complexity from native libraries. Reference implementations (Dire Wolf, aprslib) serve as correctness oracles for test case generation, not as code to wrap.
